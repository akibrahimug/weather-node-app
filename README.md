# weather-node-app

## Similar to my Node.js Movie app.

 This weather app uses the Node `HTTPS` API to retrive the temperature, clouds and humity of a given city.
 This all happens in the terminal.
 
 ### How it works. 
 
 1. Open the file path for the app in your prefered text editor or teminal.
 2. In your Terminal type `node app.js` + ` city name`
